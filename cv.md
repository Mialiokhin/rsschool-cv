### About myself:

My expertise lies in the field of engineering geodesy, which is concerned with the Earth's shape and size. In my
professional experience, I have created various geodetic networks, such as those used for airfields and state purposes,
including satellite, altitude, and Earth gravity networks. I have solved complex problems in this field and have often
needed to develop new software.

Working both independently and in teams, I have gained extensive experience in managing people, developing
documentation, communicating with customers, and considering diverse viewpoints. In addition to my geodesy work, I have
also pursued frontend development as a hobby since childhood, using tools like Joomla and HTML/CSS to create simple
webpages.

Now, I have decided to pursue a new career path as a front-end developer, as I find it enjoyable and challenging. I am
motivated to learn and explore new technologies in order to become a highly sought-after specialist in this field.

    return 'Even'
